~ Shutdown-PC-Gui ~

This program lets you set a timer to shut down your PC or if you will, abort the shutdown.



~ SHUTDOWN ~
Once you have opened the shutdown.exe, you have to clear the placeholder ("Enter minutes left until shutdown") and enter the desired time left in minutes. After you have inserted the time, once you click the button below "shutdown" the program will write a cmd command 'shutdown -s -t xxxx', which starts the countdown.

~ CANCEL SHUTDOWN ~
If you would like to abort it, then all you have to do is, open the cancel_shutdown.exe and click on the "Cancel shutdown" button, which enters 'shutdown /a' in the cmd.
