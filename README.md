# Shutdown-PC-Gui
This program lets you set a timer to shut down your PC or if you will, abort the shutdown.

The source code can be found next to the exe files.
If you have any question, please contact me, or if you would like to leave a feedback, you can do it on my github!

Thanks for trying out my program!:D
